# GWebDev FNF Video Code
This is my research on how to play videos in openfl haxeflixel (webm only supported)
# How To Setup
BEFORE SETUP apologies to benlonghair the war has ended ok so \
(btw this is for `Friday Night Funkin`)
1. Download the Friday Night Funkin source code in https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin and follow `EVERYTHING` (including the git part which is very important) (make sure its the new file system otherwise you need to put extra code `which i have the solution for lol`)
2. Install actuate by doing `haxelib install actuate`
3. Install the extension-webm fork by doing `haxelib git extension-webm https://github.com/GrowtopiaFli/extension-webm`
4. It won't work lol so type the command `lime rebuild extension-webm [windows/mac/linux]` (depends on your device)
(sry idk how to fix this for mac)
5. Download the zip of this repository and copy paste the files inside the `source` folder to your fnf source code's `source` folder
6. Edit the `Main.hx` file in the fnf source code \
Then add after the code
```js
addChild(new FlxGame(gameWidth, gameHeight, initialState, zoom, updateframerate, drawframerate, skipSplash, startFullscreen));
```
And before code
```js
#if !mobile
addChild(new FPS(10, 3, 0xFFFFFF));
#end
```
The code
```js
var ourSource:String = "assets/videos/DO NOT DELETE OR GAME WILL CRASH/dontDelete.webm";

#if web
var str1:String = "HTML CRAP";
var vHandler = new VideoHandler();
vHandler.init1();
vHandler.video.name = str1;
addChild(vHandler.video);
vHandler.init2();
GlobalVideo.setVid(vHandler);
vHandler.source(ourSource);
#elseif desktop
var str1:String = "WEBM SHIT"; 
var webmHandle = new WebmHandler();
webmHandle.source(ourSource);
webmHandle.makePlayer();
webmHandle.webm.name = str1;
addChild(webmHandle.webm);
GlobalVideo.setWebm(webmHandle);
#end
```
So it would look something like
```js
addChild(new FlxGame(gameWidth, gameHeight, initialState, zoom, updateframerate, drawframerate, skipSplash, startFullscreen));
		
var ourSource:String = "assets/videos/DO NOT DELETE OR GAME WILL CRASH/dontDelete.webm";
		
#if web
var str1:String = "HTML CRAP";
var vHandler = new VideoHandler();
vHandler.init1();
vHandler.video.name = str1;
addChild(vHandler.video);
vHandler.init2();
GlobalVideo.setVid(vHandler);
vHandler.source(ourSource);
#elseif desktop
var str1:String = "WEBM SHIT"; 
var webmHandle = new WebmHandler();
webmHandle.source(ourSource);
webmHandle.makePlayer();
webmHandle.webm.name = str1;
addChild(webmHandle.webm);
GlobalVideo.setWebm(webmHandle);
#end

#if !mobile
addChild(new FPS(10, 3, 0xFFFFFF));
#end
```
# Setting up `Project.xml`
1. Edit `Project.xml` in the fnf source code
2. Find the section with `<haxelib name="etc" />`
3. Add these two extra lines
```xml
<haxelib name="actuate" />
<haxelib name="extension-webm" if="desktop" />
```
4. `FOLLOW THIS 4TH STEP ONLY IF YOUR USING THE OLD FILE SYSTEM`
In the section with `<assets path="bla">` \
Add these two lines
```xml
<assets path="assets/videos" include="*.mp3" if="web"/>
<assets path="assets/videos" include="*.ogg" unless="web"/>
```
5. If your in the new file system \
Create a new folder named `videos` inside assets/preload \
If your in the old file system \
Create a new folder named `videos` inside assets
6. Paste the `DO NOT DELETE OR GAME WILL CRASH` folder inside the videos folder (either assets/preload/videos or assets/videos `SOURCE CODE SPECIFIC`) if you don't you know what happens, game crashes.
# Setting up the desktop build
For all you windows users out there
You need to do an extra step
You must know how to use cmd or `Command Prompt` or `Terminal` for mac or something idk i don't have a mac \
(sorry but this is only for `64 bit` architectures)
1. Download ffmpeg
https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases (please download the gpl shared version there is also download for mac please download ffprobe: https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg)
2. Extract the zip file to your choice
3. Go inside the `bin` folder inside the extracted zip file
4. Open `Command Prompt`
5. Change directory inside the `bin` folder
6. `More on this later`
# Understanding of how video works
As you know, this only supports `webm` video files not `mp4` or `any other file type` \
The reasoning of this is because of the different types of codecs not embedded inside openfl \
Let me give an explanation \
`Video Files` require a `codec` \
a codec is an `encoder` or a `decoder` for video files \
You `CANNOT` compress video files to a smaller size in modern times because they are already `COMPRESSED` and that is why we have `codecs` so you can't push the limit \
OpenFL has no codec embedded into it that's why someone who made `openfl-webm` coded the webm codec from scratch using `c++` for haxe/openfl \
But if you will ask `Why does it work for html?` \
It's because when it comes to html the `BROWSER` has the codec \
If you were to do it Natively `Native means an application that uses the system's commands instead of depending on other software like browsers which is for html5`, there are no codecs built into it. \
Now if you were to ask `Why is it named extension-webm if it was openfl-webm then?` It's because `openfl-webm` is ancient and broken so someone made `extension-webm` to fix it: https://github.com/HaxeExtension/extension-webm \
Now if you were to ask `Then why did i install https://github.com/GrowtopiaFli/extension-webm instead of https://github.com/HaxeExtension/extension-webm then?` It's because i added some extra code in `WebmPlayer.hx` to fix memory leaks. \
Now if you were to ask `What are memory leaks?` well a memory leak is a thing wherein the memory is stuffed and not freed, in basic terms, your `RAM` processes more data. \
Why you ask? it's because the video isn't being replaced but keep being added each time. \
How did i fix this issue you asked? i added extra code to `WebmPlayer.hx` which allows you to change the `SOURCE VIDEO` of the webm player anytime.
# Solution for the desktop build
Now how will we setup the video on desktop? \
Well in webm player there is `NO` audio support because it's broken lol so now we are in trouble but do not worry because ffmpeg is here to save us. \
My solution is to `Audio Sync` a way of Synchronizing the audio version of the video to the video `You must have an ogg file either just the video's audio or just empty audio that lasts as long as the video's time (i made a solution so if you don't have audio on your video then just don't make an ogg file)`. \
So back to that ffmpeg change directory folder is a ffprobe command template i have
```cmd
ffprobe -v error -count_frames -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=nb_read_frames -of default=nokey=1:noprint_wrappers=1 "yourvideo.mp4"
```
Ok so my recommendation is to Convert your video to webm then convert that webm to an mp4 because sometimes there are frame losses to webm files which fails the `Audio Sync`. \
This command logs the number of frames your video has and now you may ask. \
`If i have to convert webm to an mp4 because of frame loss for ffprobe why the hell can't i just input the webm file?` Well it's because ffprobe cannot detect the frame numbers in your webm files so you have to use a different format. \
Now you may ask `What am i suppose to do with the frame numbers?` You have to make your video name first. \
Let me give a video name sample of `video`. \
Now inside the videos folder in either `assets/preload/videos` or `assets/videos` `(SOURCE CODE SPECIFIC)` if the video name is `video` then make a file called `video.txt` and put the frame numbers there as easy as that. \
2. put your webm file in so it will be `video.webm` \
3. put the ogg converted file in so it will be `video.ogg` \
`IMPORTANT NOTE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT CODECS FOR WEBM FILES THE SPECIFIC ONE IS VP8 WHILE VP9 AND OTHERS AREN'T SUPPORTED`
# Usage of the player
You can edit `VideoState.hx` all you want but the usage of the `VideoState` class is pretty simple. \
The return must be a new class but i made a separate `VideoState.hx` file inside the `function` folder in this repository to change the callback to a function.
```js
FlxG.switchState(new VideoState('assets/videos/yoursourcevideo.webm', new YourClass(), your frameskip limit which you can leave blank or put a frameskip limit you can fill this parameter voluntarily and it must be an integer not a decimal, [true/false] (if it is true, the music playing will automatically be paused, this is good for midway videos while playing or idk for pausing the game and showing the video cutscene)));
```
YourClass is your callback class which is called once the video ends so you put your own logic idk \
Frameskip limit should be an integer not a decimal \
enter true or false for music auto pause and resume \
WARNING WARNING! function is very unstable and won't work do not copy the contents of the `function` folder please and also you make your own class with code or something idk i won't be your coding teacher ask kadedev or something idk
